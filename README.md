# Moss Process Analysis

This script allows to process the list of processes used by the client in the log file.

The script will do a web search for each process on the web (Qwant) and then take a picture to analyze quickly rather than typing a process and then search manually.

## Installation and configuration
* 1 - Download NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* 2 - Download the archive of this repository
* 3 - Extract content to a folder
* 4 - Place your `Logfile.log` file at the root of `main.js`
* 5 - Launch a cmd and type : `node main.js`
* 6 - Let the script work, once the script is finished you will find all the images in the `/images` folder.
